1. Linear Regression
To understand the working functionality of Linear Regression, imagine how you would arrange random logs of wood in increasing order of their weight. There is a catch; however – you cannot weigh each log. You have to guess its weight just by looking at the height and girth of the log (visual analysis) and arranging them using a combination of these visible parameters. This is what linear regression in machine learning is like.

In this process, a relationship is established between independent and dependent variables by fitting them to a line. This line is known as the regression line and is represented by a linear equation Y= a *X + b.

In this equation:

Y – Dependent Variable
a – Slope
X – Independent variable
b – Intercept
The coefficients a & b are derived by minimizing the sum of the squared difference of distance between data points and the regression line.
